# Code Challenge - Live Vehicle Map

Dear Future autofleet developer,

This challenge is our way to know you better before we move on to the next phase, if you are here we already talked on the phone, feel free to call us back if you need any help.

In this repository you will find the vehicles_location.json file, this file includes more than 1000 vehicle locations in London.

The purpose of this task is to enable the fleet manager to see the vehicle locations, and to be able to choose vehicles within an area, this is achieved by drawing a polygon on the map (and see their ids).

In order to build this feature, you will need to have both a server and a client, the server will have one endpoint to query all of the vehicle locations, and one to get vehicles ids that are inside of the specific polygon.
The server can be built in Node.js, Python or Java, whichever you feel most comfortable with

The client will show a map and list of selected vehicles ids (if the user created a polygon), all server requests should be done with HTTP requests.
The client can be built using any technology stack.

The final product should be presented as a web URL (a live website) or a Docker file.
For deployment, you can use Heroku, Google App Engine or any other provider.

Your task will be evaluated with the following criteria:
1. Clean and efficient code
2. Architecture design
3. Product usability (responsiveness, load time...)
4. Esthetics - Bonus

## Need Help?
You can decide to submit an unfinished task (git repository) if you do, and we decide that itâ€™s good enough, you will be invited to the office to try and finish the task with us (max 60min).
** You only have one submission, use it wisely**
